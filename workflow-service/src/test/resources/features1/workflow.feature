Feature: Tests the Chenile Workflow Service using a REST client. A mfg service exists and is under test.
It helps to create a MfgModel and manages the state of the MfgModel as follows:
INITIATED -(putInAssemblyLine) -> IN_ASSEMBLY_LINE -> (finishManufacturing) -> OUT_OF_ASSEMBLY_LINE
 
  Scenario: Test create MfgModel
    When I POST a REST request to URL "/mfg" with payload
    """json
    {
	}
	"""
    Then the REST response contains key "mutatedEntity"
    And store "$.payload.mutatedEntity.id" from response to "id"
    And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" is "INITIATED"
	  
	Scenario: Retrieve the MfgModel that just got created
		When I GET a REST request to URL "/mfg/${id}"
		Then the REST response contains key "mutatedEntity"
	  And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.id" is "${id}"
